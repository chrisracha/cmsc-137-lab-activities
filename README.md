# CMSC 137 Lab Activities

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for two laboratory activities for CMSC 137: Data Communications. Each lab demonstrates key concepts in digital and analog communication systems.

## Lab 1: Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

This lab demonstrates:
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM):** Generation and visualization of message and carrier signals.
- **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):** Simulation of digital modulation using a user-input binary sequence, with visualization of the binary message, carrier, and modulated signals.

### How to Run
1. Open `CMSC137_LabActivity1_Salcedo.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script. For Part B, you will be prompted to enter a 12-bit binary sequence (e.g., `101010101010`).
3. The script will display plots for the message, carrier, and modulated signals.

## Lab 2: Two-Dimensional Parity Check and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

This lab demonstrates:
- **Two-Dimensional Parity Check:** Encoding a string into binary, generating row and column parity bits, and simulating various error scenarios.
- **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):** Computing CRC for an 8-bit input using a generator polynomial, and displaying the transmitted codeword.

### How to Run
1. Open `CMSC137_LabAct2_Mazo_Salcedo.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script. For the CRC section, you will be prompted to enter an 8-bit binary sequence (e.g., `11010111`).
3. The script will display the results for both parity check and CRC computations.
